A [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) template for Python projects that enforces best practices from the first commit — and ships AI coding agents that already know and follow every one of them.

---

## What this is

**agentic-uv** generates a production-ready Python project with:

- Strict linting, type checking, security scanning, and coverage enforcement wired up and passing before you write a single line of business logic
- A full CI/CD pipeline covering quality, security, and multi-version testing out of the box
- Pre-configured `.claude/` and `.copilot/` directories that give AI coding agents (OpenCode, GitHub Copilot) complete, structured knowledge of every quality rule, testing convention, and deployment workflow in the project

The key idea: the agents don't just have access to your code — they ship with explicit, up-to-date instructions on how this specific project is built, tested, and maintained. They enforce the same standards a senior engineer would.

---

## Best-Practice Enforcement — Baked In

Every generated project starts with the full quality stack already configured and passing:

### Code Quality
- [**ruff**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) — linter and formatter with 18+ rule sets (security, complexity, performance, style, imports)
- [**mypy**](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [**ty**](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/) — strict static type checking, no implicit `Any`
- [**bandit**](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) — security scanning on every commit via pre-commit
- [**vulture**](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) — dead code detection on every commit
- [**deptry**](https://github.com/fpgmaas/deptry/) — unused, missing, and transitive dependency detection (optional)
- [**pre-commit**](https://pre-commit.com/) — all checks run automatically before any commit lands

### Testing & Coverage
- [**pytest**](https://docs.pytest.org/) with [**pytest-cov**](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/) and [**pytest-xdist**](https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/)
- **80% coverage threshold enforced** — CI fails if coverage drops below 80%
- [**hypothesis**](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) — property-based testing with starter examples included
- [**mutmut**](https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/) — mutation testing to verify test quality
- Integration test scaffold under `tests/integration/`

### Security Auditing
- [**pip-audit**](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) — dependency vulnerability scanning
- Weekly scheduled security audit in CI (bandit + pip-audit)
- `make audit` runs the full security check locally

### CI/CD
- [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions) — quality, security, and test jobs on every push and PR
- Multi-Python-version matrix: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
- Optional [**Codecov**](https://about.codecov.io/) integration

### Documentation
- Optional [**MkDocs**](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with Material theme, auto-deployed to GitHub Pages

### Containerization
- Optional [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) / [**Podman**](https://podman.io/) support

## Agent-Based Development

Every generated project ships with fully pre-configured agent context in `.claude/` (OpenCode) and `.copilot/` (GitHub Copilot). The agents don't need to discover the project conventions — they are given them explicitly.

### What agents know from day one

Each agent loads a structured set of rules covering every aspect of the project:

| Rule file | What the agent learns |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `code-style.md` | Type hints, naming conventions, formatting standards |
| `testing.md` | pytest patterns, coverage requirements, fixture design |
| `best-practices.md` | Security standards, type safety, error handling |
| `deployment.md` | CI/CD workflows, release process, GitHub Actions |
| `commit-guidelines.md` | Conventional commit format enforced on every commit |
| `agent-interaction.md` | How to work iteratively — no premature session termination |
| `implementation-strategy.md` | Risk assessment and implementation planning approach |
| `error-handling.md` | Error propagation, exception design, logging standards |

### OpenCode skills included

Agents can load specialised skills for common workflows:

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `lint-project` | Runs `make check` — ruff, mypy, pre-commit, deptry |
| `test-project` | Runs `make test` — pytest with coverage reporting |
| `check-project` | Full pipeline — lint then test |
| `post-change-validation` | Recommends the right validation skill after any code change |
| `coding-standards` | Detects anti-patterns, code smells, readability issues |
| `implementation-approach` | Selects vertical/horizontal/hybrid strategy with risk assessment |
| `subagents-orchestration-guide` | Orchestrates multi-agent task distribution for large features |

### Subagent definitions included

For complex features, a full set of specialised subagents is pre-defined:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `requirement-analyzer` | Analyses scope and determines implementation scale |
| `prd-creator` | Produces structured Product Requirements Documents |
| `technical-designer` | Creates Architecture Decision Records and Design Docs |
| `work-planner` | Breaks Design Docs into phased, ordered work plans |
| `task-decomposer` | Decomposes work plans into atomic implementation tasks |
| `task-executor` | Executes a single task and returns structured output |
| `quality-fixer` | Runs the full QA pipeline and self-heals until all checks pass |
| `document-reviewer` | Reviews any document for completeness and consistency |
| `design-sync` | Verifies consistency across multiple Design Docs |
| `acceptance-test-generator` | Generates integration test skeletons from acceptance criteria |
| `integration-test-reviewer` | Reviews integration and E2E tests against skeletons |

## Quickstart

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project, then run:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/NoxelS/agentic-uv.git
```

Or without `uv`:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/NoxelS/agentic-uv.git
```

Follow the prompts. Once complete, navigate into the generated directory and run:

```bash
make install   # set up virtualenv and pre-commit hooks
make check     # linting, type checking, security scanning
make test      # pytest with coverage
```

Everything passes on a fresh project. Start writing code in `your_project/`.

**agentic-uv** extends the original with agent-based development support, stricter quality tooling, enhanced security scanning, property-based and mutation testing, and a dual `.claude/` / `.copilot/` configuration for AI-assisted workflows.
